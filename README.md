# Spotify-clone
A front-end clone of Spotify’s web player, built using HTML and CSS.
This project recreates the modern Spotify interface with a sidebar, navigation controls, music cards, and a responsive player layout — designed purely with front-end technologies (no JavaScript or backend).
Features:-
Spotify-inspired UI: Clean and minimal interface similar to the real Spotify Web Player.
Sidebar Navigation: “Home”, “Search”, and “Your Library” sections with hover effects.
Music Cards: Displays playlists, trending songs, and featured charts.
Music Player Controls: Includes play, pause, forward, backward, shuffle, and volume icons.
Responsive Layout: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox and media queries.
Custom Styling: Built entirely with CSS3 (no frameworks needed).
